# Geek's Portfolio

> My very simple and minimalist portfolio

### Data loading

Only the homepage needs to be updated in the code in `src/pages/Home.svelte`.

The projects are loaded from github, update the username in `src/consts.ts` file.

The value of `GITHUB_TOPIC` variable should be added as topic in all of the repos you want to show in projects page

The blogs will be loaded from notion (yet to do)
